# Project3_pre-start-checks-web-app-cg

MERN Stack Single-Page Application for monitoring the preventing maintenance of selected machines of a factory through pre-start checks of each machine on a daily basis as per use.

# User Story
AS a Maintenance Manager of a company that operates machines and equipment for manufacturing processes, I WANT to register a questionnaire form, edit and delete information about my pre-start checks of all machines on a daily basis. SO THAT I can keep track and a perform preventive maintenance. 
Acceptance Criteria GIVEN a machine. WHEN an operator starts the machine first thing in the morning. THEN he/she is able to register the details and status of that machine and communicate promptly to the Maintenance team about the machine status through answering the only questionnaire presented in the app. THEN the I am presented with all the information of each Pre-start-check Log on the dashboard page of the application. ALSO, the I can register different users with unique login sessions.
